To-Do

General:
- Clean up the codebase
	- Check to ensure adherence toproper c# style guidelines
	- Try to adhere to SOLID.
	- Try to move some logic (e.g. setting up config) to App.xaml.cs as this is 
	where app logic goes.



UI:
- Stop user from clicking button without setting up CLI OR without providing
valid input.
- Stop user from clicking buttons WHILE app is doing work.
- Add reset button that clears all fields and resets the app to its initial state.
